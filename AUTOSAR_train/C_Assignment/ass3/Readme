Here are 2 exercises of assignment 3 
Description:
Both exercises, as I understand them, are based on the ideas of two data structures: vector and linked list.

Ex 1 is a vector with an initial array that is statically allocated and the addition mechanism is also based on the size attribute.
    - In add mechanism you must input position that must be less or equal size at runtime.

Ex 2 is a linked list that manages an array, so you only need to use the next pointers in the struct node to point to consecutive memory areas of the array.
About sorting i just use ascending order for bove exercises.
