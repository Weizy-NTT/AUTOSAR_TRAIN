Both fixes involve assigning pointers and ensuring that the pointer's data type matches the data type it points to.
For specific:
- s = (char **)&foo;   
s is pointer to pointer so the value assigned for this pointer is address of a pointer 
&foo just address of whole string not address of pointer so we need to cast it to address of pointer to pointer 
=> compiler will assumpt address of whole string as addres of pointer 
- c = (char *) &s[0]; 
Similar like above case:
because in print command it fix *c so c must be point to address of first character at this string
=> &s[0]  is address of the first string and we must cast &s[0] to 1level pointer => compiler will assumpt &s[0] is address of 1 character.

Mainly an exercise to get familiar with function pointers as well as the mindset of callback functions to stratify the program.
The program allows the user to enter an account and will respond to the user based on the value the user enters.
