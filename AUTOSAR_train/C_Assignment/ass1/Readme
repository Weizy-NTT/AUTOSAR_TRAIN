************************** Design *****************************
I chose Linked List instead of an array to implement the program for the following two main reasons:

- Dont require pre-allocating memory avoiding both memory waste and limitations.
=> Linked List can store data of unlimited size

- Adding or removing elements only requires updating pointers, unlike arrays which may involve shifting elements.
=> This structure is ideal for problems requiring frequent modifications (insertions, deletions, sorting).

************************** User manual ************************
Enter ‘c’ to create an integer array (If there is an array, clear the data of the old array).
Enter ‘p’ to print the array (If the array has no value, report the array is empty).
Enter ‘i’ to add an element to the array at the kth position decided by the user.
Enter ‘d’ to delete an element at the kth position (If position k does not contain a value, report that there is no element k).
Enter ‘s’ to sort the array in ascending order.
Enter ‘x’ to sort in descending order.
Enter ‘t’ to search for a number x in the array (x entered from the keyboard)?
If you enter ‘e’, exit the program.

During runtime if user input wrong value => Input again

************************** Notice *****************************
Use command for build and run
- Use "make" command to build.
- Use "make run" to run program after step build.
- Use "make clean" to clear all built files.
